# How do I get my .SCFORMSAUTH?

The SCFORMSAUTH is a cookie for elevcentralen. On mobile devices it is alot harder to see your cookies than it is on a computer. If you do not know how to view your cookies, please google how to view your cookies, something along the lines of (remove '<' '>')
```
How do I view my cookies in <WEB_BROWSER> on <OPERATING_SYSTEM>?
```

After you have figured this out we can continue.

- Login to elevcentralen
- View your cookies in your browser, in my case, Chromium (e.g Edge, Google Chrome, Opera, Brave) I have to press the padlock icon next to url and then click the "Cookies" button.

Now this is going to be different depending on you browser, I will post a guide over how I do it, but can you either search on google or use this guide:

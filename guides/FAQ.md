## What is Free Time Finder?
***
Free Time Finder makes it easier to find availible driving lessons by using a better interface than Elevcentralen. In Free Time Finder you can select multiple teachers and see a day, week and month view of the available times. 

**OSB! Free Time Finder is only made for finding a free time, you have to go to Elevcentralen yourself to book it!**

## Is Free Time Finder safe?
***
The SCFORMSAUTH cookie authenticates you at Elevcentralen and someone with this cookie and bad intent could do harm with it, I have no such intent and the code running on the backend server has not been modified to be different from the one here on github. For this reason this entire project is open source and you can run or build it yourself.
